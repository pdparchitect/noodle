# Changelog

All notable changes to Noodle are documented here, following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Click a bot's avatar in a group message to see its public profile, address it by name in the composer, or open its direct conversation.
- Type `@` in the chat composer to find bot names, navigate suggestions with the arrow keys, and insert a plain-text name with Return, Tab or a click.
- Privacy-safe runtime lifecycle and inbox-read logs in debug and release builds, with wake correlation IDs and extra debug-only notification diagnostics.
- A shared message/event catalogue generates agent guidance, Messenger help, and the message reference, with build and test checks for documentation drift.

- First-class Claude Code harness support with crisp vector Claude Code and Codex marks, native-install discovery, isolated account setup, standard Fable, Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku choices, effort controls, persistent stream-json sessions, supervised recovery, and Messenger-based conversations.
- An opt-in General setting that prevents automatic Mac sleep only while at least one agent is working.
- Supervised agent runtimes that restart after unexpected Codex exits or Mac wake, use bounded retry backoff, and safely resume interrupted work.
- Native link previews for safe public web links, with compact cards, lazy loading, and inline image previews.
- Public bot descriptions, group membership notices, and a Messenger roster command that reports each participant's name, description, and conversation-local activity without exposing private backstories.
- Public group descriptions that are editable, searchable, visible in the conversation, and supplied to every member as shared context. Description changes notify the group.

### Changed

- Bot startup instructions now point to the Messenger skill instead of repeating its full guidance, reducing redundant agent context while preserving backstories.
- Autonomous harness launch now validates either OpenAI's signed Codex package or Anthropic's signed Claude Code native install and maps provider settings to fixed commands without exposing an arbitrary execution endpoint.
- Long conversations keep transcript loading off the main thread, reuse parsed Markdown, virtualize off-screen messages, defer attachment thumbnails until visible, batch scroll-position updates, and use indexed attachment lookups to reduce typing and scrolling stalls.
- Sidebar message previews now show clean plain text without displaying Markdown syntax.
- Link and attachment previews use compact, top-leading layouts and repair incorrectly labelled image attachments when possible.

### Fixed

- Bot workspace bootstrap exposes shared skills through Claude Code's native `.claude/skills` discovery path, preserving existing Claude settings and native skills.
- Editor sheets resize in both directions as their content changes, avoiding gaps and clipped headers; large group membership grids scroll within a bounded height.
- Claude bots recover from explicitly missing saved sessions instead of endlessly restarting; new session IDs are saved only after Claude confirms startup, and unrelated failures preserve existing session pointers.
- Inbox-read diagnostics are relayed by Noodle when sandboxed Messenger commands cannot reach macOS logging, including successful empty checks and read failures.
- The application-menu update command remains responsive after Sparkle enables update checks.
- Harness icons use transparent vector templates that inherit native foreground styling alongside system symbols; Codex path rendering no longer clips on macOS.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Persistent last-heartbeat information for every bot.
- Stable, human-readable names for the Codex sessions created by Noodle agents.
- A real product screenshot and a download-focused project README.

### Changed

- Local development builds now use isolated data by default, with an explicit production-data build mode when shared state is required.
- Agent access is autonomous by default, while per-bot restrictions remain available.
- Groups can be renamed without changing their identifiers, membership, or history.
- Messages render inline Markdown, and the chat composer uses a Liquid Glass treatment.
- Conversations scroll beneath the composer and fade beneath the window toolbar.
- The redundant workspace button was removed from conversation headers; workspace access remains in the sidebar context menu.

### Fixed

- Heartbeat idleness survives app relaunches instead of restarting whenever Noodle opens.
- Chat bubble styling, unread indicators, transcript fades, and bottom-edge scrolling remain legible across conversation backgrounds.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Guided Codex installation and sign-in setup with clearer runtime and model selection.
- Configurable bot-name styles, defaulting to conventional real names.
- File and Image Playground artwork for bot icons, plus generated conversation backgrounds.
- Continuous spelling assistance in the chat composer and bot editor.
- Improved single-member group presentation and heartbeat interval controls.

### Changed

- Settings and modal sheets fit their content and keep dynamically changing controls stable.
- Bot creation and editing use simpler, provider-neutral language and controls.

### Fixed

- Extended agents resolve the correct application container and validate the official Codex installation correctly.
- Bot icon generation avoids unwanted personalization and no longer requires seed text.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Configurable, independent inactivity heartbeats for persistent agents.
- Optional extended agent access through a separately signed host, with per-bot security controls.
- Single-bot groups and a searchable avatar-based membership picker.
- Durable Messenger chat effects, including foreground confetti with replay and reduced-motion support.
- Recovery for unread notifications and inbox cursors stored outside managed skill files.

### Changed

- SuperBot was renamed to Noodle across the app, modules, bundle identifiers, documentation, release pipeline, and artwork.
- Settings were reorganized and runtime diagnostics moved into a debug-only developer tab.

### Security

- Extended access requires the trusted Codex installation and is isolated in a hardened helper rather than widening the main app sandbox.
- Confirmation-only tool requests gained explicit consent handling.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Signed in-app updates through Sparkle, including automatic checks and optional automatic installation.
- Signed update feeds and checksums published with every GitHub release.

### Changed

- Update relaunches wait until active agents, drafts, attachments, editors, and shared-item deliveries are safe to interrupt.

### Security

- The updater bootstrap validates signed archives and integrates with the notarized release pipeline.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Native attachment paste, browser drag-and-drop, and context-menu copying.
- Message reactions for users and agents, including named reaction history through Messenger.
- A native Settings window showing detected agent harnesses.
- A sandboxed macOS Share extension and Services-based sharing composer.
- Private per-conversation backgrounds for both bots and groups, including Photos Library import.
- Group editing from sidebar context menus.

### Fixed

- Agent startup I/O and large history decoding no longer block the interface.
- Conversation scroll positions restore without delayed jumps or cumulative drift.
- Transcript fades and background transitions remain correctly layered around the toolbar and messages.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- The first native macOS release, originally named SuperBot, with persistent direct and group conversations.
- Long-running Codex agents with stable private workspaces, editable backstories, model settings, and durable conversation history.
- The agent-local Messenger command for named message delivery, group communication, and file attachments.
- Native bot icons and avatars, inline attachment thumbnails, Quick Look previews, and drag-and-drop attachments.
- Background reply notifications, unread conversation indicators, and Spotlight/Shortcuts quick-send actions.
- Group membership editing and confirmed deletion for bots and groups.

### Security

- Signed and notarized macOS packaging with a dedicated Developer ID identity.
- Sandboxed messaging and explicit attachment paths for agent file access.
